*** Bluetooth network configuration in /etc/net ***

To set up a BT connection between two /etc/net managed Linux hosts,
you will need 2 BT interfaces with distinct MAC addresses. BT MAC
addresses are 6 bytes long, like Ethernet MAC addresses, and can
be displayed with "hcitool dev" command. You need "bluetooth" service
running to access BT interfaces.
