.SH "DESCRIPTION"
/etc/net is a network configuration system. It should be both simple to use for a beginner and powerful for expert. First of all you have to describe your network connection(s) in a set of files. Once you are done it, you should be able to control state of your host with 3 scripts: ifup, ifdown, network.init.
