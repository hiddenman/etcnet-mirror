This is an early build of /etc/net for Fedora, it is not provided as a part of
Fedora Core or Extras or Rawhide. To install /etc/net you will need to setup
an additional repository:

cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/etcnet.repo << EOF
[etcnet]
name=Fedora Core $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=http://moscow.etcnet.org/pub/etcnet/$releasever/RPMS
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1

EOF

# yum install etcnet
You should be offered to upgrade initscripts.

Thank you for interest.
