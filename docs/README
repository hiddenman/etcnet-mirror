/etc/net version 0.8.6

===
=== INTRODUCTION
===
/etc/net (etcnet) is a modern network configuration system for Linux.
The project's goal is to make network management in Linux more
convenient; to make modern networking technologies available.
/etc/net helps configuring the following network interfaces: wired and
wireless Ethernet, IP tunnels, IPSec static tunnels, VLANs, PLIP, Ethernet
bonding and bridges, traffic equalizers, dummy, DVB and usbnet interfaces,
TUN/TAP and OpenVPN TUN/TAP, PPP, PPTP and PPPoE. /etc/net supports IPv4, IPv6 and IPX.

===
=== INSTALLATION
===
Please refer to distribution-specific INSTALL file.
Right after the installation you usually have a running system and the
default /etc/net configuration, which only brings up loopback interface.
If you reboot, you will end up with a networkless Linux host.

===
=== CONFIGURATION
===
You can start building the configuration for your next reboot from scratch
or you can run /etc/net/scripts/contrib/initconf and examine its output.
The script usually generates adequate configurations for simple setups.
If you are happy with its suggestions, run the scripts once more with
"write" parameter and you will have something to continue with.

After you are done with /etc/net configuration, you probaly have to fix
some things in the rest of the system:

You must review your /etc/sysconfig/network file and check NETWORKING
and CONFMETHOD variables:

NETWORKING=yes
CONFMETHOD=etcnet

Please note that FORWARD_IPV4, GATEWAY and GATEWAYDEV variables are
net-scripts specific and are ignored by /etc/net.

Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and remove the lines that are present
in /etc/net/sysctl.conf.

# chkconfig --list network
You may need to run 'chkconfig network reset' (this is a known bug).

=== MORE INFORMATION
