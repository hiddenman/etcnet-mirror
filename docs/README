*** README for /etc/net version 0.8.3 ***

/etc/net (etcnet) is a modern network configuration system for Linux.
The project's goal is to make network management in Linux more
convenient; to make modern networking technologies available.
/etc/net helps configuring the following network interfaces: wired and
wireless Ethernet, IP tunnels, IPSec static tunnels, VLANs, PLIP, Ethernet
bonding and bridges, traffic equalizers, dummy, DVB and usbnet interfaces,
PPP, PPTP and PPPoE. /etc/net supports IPv4, IPv6 and IPX.
For details about /etc/net design configuration see etcnet(8) manpage,
project's web-site (http://etcnet.org/) and configuration examples.
