                     /etc/net and OpenVPN

"iplink" file DOES NOT work for ovpn interfaces due to the design
of OpenVPN software. The only reliable way to set MAC-address of an
ovpn TAP-interface to some fixed value is to use "lladdr" option
of openvpn daemon (which is only available in OpenVPN version 2.1
unless intentionally backported to 2.0). This is done through usual
"ovpnoptions" file in interface's config directory.
