Most hosts have 1 or 0 parallel ports.
If you have more and need configured all of them, try
using different 'baseaddress 0xXXX' maps for each iface.
Also note that you will need appropriate modules.conf
entries like:
alias plip0 plip
alias plip1 plip
alias parport0 parport
alias parport1 parport
below plip parport_pc
below parport_pc parport 
options parport io=0x3f8,0x3bc
I can't check if this works now.
