0. apt-get install etcnet

1. vi /etc/sysconfig/network
Pay attention to NETWORKING and CONFMETHOD variables
Note that FORWARD_IPV4, GATEWAY and GATEWAYDEV variables are
ignored by /etc/net.

2. Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and remove the lines that are present
in /etc/net/sysctl.conf.

3. chkconfig --list network
You may need to run 'chkconfig network reset' (known bug).
