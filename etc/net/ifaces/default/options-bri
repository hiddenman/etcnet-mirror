# From bridge-STP-HOWTO:
# There is a number of rules you are not allowed to break (otherwise
# your bridge will do).
# * A port can only be a member of one bridge.
# * A bridge knows nothing about routes.
# * A bridge knows nothing about higher protocols than ARP. That's the
#   reason why it can bridge any possible protocol possibly running on
#   your Ethernet.
# * No matter how many ports you have in your logical bridge, it's
#   covered by only one logical interface.
# * As soon as a port (e.g. a NIC) is added to a bridge you have no
#   more direct control about it.
###
# Note on brtcl options file.
# If brctl file exists in interface directory, it will be processed like
# iplink/ipv4address files with one exception. Current order of arguments
# to brctl binary does not allow us to omit bridge name in brctl options
# file. So you must either duplicate your bridge name in brctl options or
# use AUTO to let setup-bri substitute it with current bridge name.

# With default values you will have your ethernet slaves up after bridge
# shutdown. To have your ethers be shut down too, uncomment the following
# setting, but remember to have IFDOWN_CHILDREN=no in all your slaves'
# options file.
#IFDOWN_PARENTS=yes

# This variable must be defined for each bridge interface. This is a
# (quoted) space-separated list of slave ethernet interfaces combining the
# bridge. Don't forget to create configurations for the slave interfaces
# too.
# Don't define this variable here, the right place is your interface's
# options file. 
#HOST=
# Optional overloading of brctl path.
#BRCTL=
