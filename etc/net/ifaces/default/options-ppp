# Default options for PPP interfaces. Comments are mostly 'man pppd' quotations.

# pppd assigns addresses itself
DONT_FLUSH=yes
ONBOOT=no

# pppd location, optional
#PPPD=<string>

# chat location, optional
#CHAT=<string>

# Terminate after n consecutive  failed  connection  attempts.   A
# value of 0 means no limit.  The default value is 10.
#MAXFAIL=<integer>

# Do  not  exit  after  a connection is terminated; instead try to
# reopen the connection. The maxfail option still has an effect on
# persistent connections. pppd default value is 'off'.
#PERSIST=<boolean>

# Specifies how many seconds to wait before re-initiating the link
# after it terminates.  This option only has  any  effect  if  the
# persist  or  demand  option  is used.  The holdoff period is not
# applied if the link was terminated because it was idle.
#HOLDOFF=<integer>

# Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link is idle for  n
# seconds.   The  link is idle when no data packets (i.e. IP pack-
# ets) are being sent or received.  Note: it is not  advisable  to
# use  this  option  with  the  persist  option without the demand
# option.  If the active-filter  option  is  given,  data  packets
# which  are  rejected by the specified activity filter also count
# as the link being idle.
#IDLE=<integer>

# Additional pppd args. Note that interface-specific options file
# will override this value, not append.
#EXTRA_PPPOPTIONS=<string>

# Note: empty pppoptions/pppinit/pppconnect/pppdisconnect files will
# not be used.
# Note: those files are not shell scripts, but chat scripts.
#
# One could override the default base for profiled pppd options file
# here, but why?

# Same for pppd init script.
