# Default options for PPP interfaces. Comments are mostly 'man pppd' quotations.

ONBOOT=no

# PPP subtype. Valid types are: dialup, pptp, pppoe.
# pptp and pptp types will benefit from correctly set REQIURES and
# respectively HOST variables. dialup subtype will add 'modem' to
# pppd options list.
PPPTYPE=dialup

# For pptp subtype you must specify hostname or IP address of PPtP server
# you connect to. Otherwise leave PPPTYPE=dialup.
#PPTP_SERVER=<string>

# pppoe client requires target interface name. You must specify it in
# the HOST variable, create-ppp will automatically construct correct
# pty option for pppd. This option is mandatory if PPPTYPE=pppoe.
#HOST=<string>

# Optional pppoe path.
#PPPOE=

# Optional pptp-client path.
#PPTP=

# pppd assigns addresses itself
DONT_FLUSH=on

# pppd location, optional
#PPPD=<string>

# chat location, optional
#CHAT=<string>

# chat options (timeout, verbose mode etc)
#CHATOPTIONS=<string>

# Terminate after n consecutive  failed  connection  attempts.   A
# value of 0 means no limit.  The default value is 10.
#PPPMAXFAIL=<integer>

# Do  not  exit  after  a connection is terminated; instead try to
# reopen the connection. The maxfail option still has an effect on
# persistent connections. pppd default value is 'off'.
#PPPPERSIST=<boolean>

# Specifies how many seconds to wait before re-initiating the link
# after it terminates.  This option only has  any  effect  if  the
# persist  or  demand  option  is used.  The holdoff period is not
# applied if the link was terminated because it was idle.
#PPPHOLDOFF=<integer>

# Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link is idle for  n
# seconds.   The  link is idle when no data packets (i.e. IP pack-
# ets) are being sent or received.  Note: it is not  advisable  to
# use  this  option  with  the  persist  option without the demand
# option.  If the active-filter  option  is  given,  data  packets
# which  are  rejected by the specified activity filter also count
# as the link being idle.
#PPPIDLE=<integer>

# Additional pppd args. Note that interface-specific options file
# will override this value, not append.
#PPPOPTIONS=<string>

# Note: empty pppoptions/pppinit/pppconnect/pppdisconnect files will
# not be used.
# Note: those files are not shell scripts, but chat scripts.
#
# One could override the default base for profiled pppd options file
# here, but why?
#PPPOPTIONSFILE=<string>

# Same for pppd init script.
#PPPINITCHAT=<string>

# ... connect script...
#PPPCONNECTCHAT=<string>

# ...and disconnect script
#PPPDISCONNECTCHAT=<script>

# TODO, this does not work yet
# pppd does not save default route for us. We could save and restore it
# with ip-up/ip-down, but this option will do the trick for us.
#RESTORE_DEFAULTROUTE=<bool>
