# BOOTPROTO can be any of the following: static, dhcp, zcip.
# * "static": use ipv4address/ipv6address
# * "dhcp": run DHCP client
# * "zcip": run ZCIP client
# As far as I know, there are no working IPv6 DHCP
# implementations. ZCIP is not required for IPv6 because of
# link-scope addresses.
# Additional feature is multi-method configurations (methods
# can be delimited by ' ', ',' or '-':
# * "dhcp-static": try DHCP, if it fails, configure static address(es)
# * "dhcp-zcip": same, but fallback to ZCIP
# * "dhcp-zcip-static": try DHCP, fallback to ZCIP (very unlikely to fail),
# fallback to static
# etcnet will try to configure interface at the first succeeding
# method. Note that etcnet will process routes and rules despite of
# BOOTPROTO.
