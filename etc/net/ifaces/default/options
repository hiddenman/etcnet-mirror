# BOOTPROTO can be any of the following: static, dhcp, ipv4ll.
# * "static": use ipv4address/ipv6address
# * "dhcp": run DHCP client
# * "ipv4ll": run IPv4LL client (zcip)
# As far as I know, there are no working IPv6 DHCP
# implementations. IPv4LL is not required for IPv6 because of
# link-scope addresses.
# Additional feature is multi-method configurations (methods
# can be delimited by ' ', ',' or '-':
# * "dhcp-static": try DHCP, if it fails, configure static address(es)
# * "dhcp-ipv4ll": same, but fallback to IPv4LL
# * "dhcp-ipv4ll-static": try DHCP, fallback to IPv4LL (very unlikely to fail),
# fallback to static
# /etc/net will try to configure interface at the first succeeding
# method. Note that etcnet will process routes and rules despite of
# BOOTPROTO.
