# LINKDETECT option allows to avoid DHCP/IPv4LL timeout, if ethernet cable is
# not plugged in during startup. This feature requires ifplugstatus
# and is off by default, because not all network cards report correct link
# status.

LINKDETECT=no

# Some network card modules create network device first, then perform
# some initialization and after some time fill in MAC address data.
# Hotplug starts working immediately after the interface is created, so
# if you use mac address match rule in iftab, it may happen to broke.
# If this variable is set to non-zero, /etc/net will wait for specified
# amount of 0.1 sec times for MAC address to become not 00:00:00:00:00:00.
