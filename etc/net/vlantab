# VLAN ifaces fast config
# One line is one VLAN iface. Line format: 

# <parent iface> <VLAN ID>
# <parent iface> <VLAN ID> <VLAN iface name>
# <parent iface> <VLAN ID> <VLAN iface name> <'ip address' parameters>

# W/o 3rd column or w/3rd column equal to 'AUTO' VLAN iface name will be
# auto-assigned based on $DEFAULT_VLAN_NAMETYPE.
# Note that you can only specify IP address in this file now. If you
# need additional configuration (ip link/ip route), create appropriate
# iface directory with required files.
