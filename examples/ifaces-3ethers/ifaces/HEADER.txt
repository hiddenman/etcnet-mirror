This example illustrates an ethernet bridge and GRE tunnel
over ethernet. Note that both bridge and tunnel have REQUIRES
variable in options file. This variable defines interface
dependencies: if bridge or iptunnel are brought up, port* and
ether respectively will be checked to be up first. In bridge
case both interfaces listed in REQUIRES will be enslaved to
the bridge.
