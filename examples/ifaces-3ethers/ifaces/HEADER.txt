This example illustrates an ethernet bridge and GRE tunnel
over ethernet. Note that bridge has HOST variable in options
file, while iptunnel uses REQUIRES option.
If bridge or iptunnel are brought up, port* and
ether respectively will be checked to be up first. In bridge
case both interfaces listed in HOST will be enslaved to
the bridge.
